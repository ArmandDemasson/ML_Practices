# Machine Learning Practices

This repository contains the implementations and exercises from the Machine Learning course taught by **Fabien Moutarde**, professor at Mines ParisTech, during my exchange program at **SPEIT (Shanghai ParisTech Elite Institute of Technology)**.

## Course Topics

The course covers various essential topics in Machine Learning, including both foundational algorithms and advanced techniques. Below is a list of the topics and corresponding practices included in this repository:

1. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
   - Implementation and tuning of SVM models for classification tasks.
   - Kernel functions, regularization, and hyperparameter optimization.

2. **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)**
   - Building feedforward neural networks for regression and classification.
   - Backpropagation, activation functions, and performance optimization.

3. **Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Boosting**
   - Exploring tree-based models, ensemble methods like Random Forest, and boosting algorithms (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).
   - Feature importance, bagging techniques, and overfitting control.

4. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
   - Developing CNNs for image classification and recognition tasks.
   - Convolution layers, pooling, dropout, and model evaluation.

5. **Transfer Learning**
   - Applying pre-trained models to new datasets.
   - Fine-tuning and transfer learning strategies for efficient training.

6. **Clustering**
   - Unsupervised learning methods including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
   - Cluster evaluation and visualization techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each corresponding to a different topic:


Each folder contains:

- **Jupyter Notebooks** with detailed explanations and code implementations.
- **Results** and model evaluations for each method.
